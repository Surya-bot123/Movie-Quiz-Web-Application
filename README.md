## Appendix
### Troubleshooting
1. **The quiz isn't displaying correctly on my device:**
* **possible Issue:** The app uses a background image and relies on a responsive design.
* **Solution:** Ensure your browser window is wide enough or try resizing it. If the background image isn't loading, check the image URL in the ```style.css``` file or replace it with another valid image URL.
2. **Questions or answers are not loading:**
* **Possible Issue:** If JavaScript isn't running correctly, it could be due to missing files or script issues.
* **Solution:** Open the browserâ€™s developer tools (press ```F12``` or ```Ctrl+Shift+I```) and check the console for any errors. Ensure the ```script.js``` file is properly linked in your index.html.
3. **The app freezes when clicking the "Next" button:**
* **Possible Issue:** This could be related to the state reset or event handling for the "Next" button.
* **Solution:** Check if the event listener on the "Next" button is set up correctly and that the ```showNextQuestion``` function is being triggered.
4. **The background image is not appearing:**
* **Possible Issue:** The image URL in the CSS file might be broken or the file might not be accessible.
* **Solution:** Check if the image URL is correct, or replace it with another image URL.
